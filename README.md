# Car-Detection
A HOG and SVM based object detection algorithm

## Histogram of Oriented Gradient
Histogram of Oriented Gradient ([HOG](https://www.learnopencv.com/histogram-of-oriented-gradients)) is a feature descriptor technique which generates features from images.

The features extracted is used for training in the SVM classifier. The classifier model generated is used for predicting whether a certain region contauns the object or not.
